I have developed application features using JavaScript, Java, and Python, and worked on DevOps tasks to improve the CI/CD pipeline. The main support tools used were Jira, GitLab and Confluence. As well as improving my development skills directly, I have learnt a great deal working with Senior Developers through for example code reviews. The internship has also given me significant experience working and communicating within a professional team environment."
